I am a master's student majoring in __Computational Finance__ at __Carnegie Mellon University__. 

My recent research interests are in __portfolio management__, __stochastic volatility models__, and __numerical methods__ in finance. I am also interested in __reinforcement learning__, __bandit algorithms__, __statistical machine learning__ and their applications in finance.

Since 2016, I initiated and led the __FBA Quant__ student research group which studies the field at the intersection of __quantitative finance__ and __data science__. I believe in the value of applying practical, cutting-edge data science technologies into traditional investment strategies.

I have also had the pleasure to participate in a project engaged with __NH Investment and Securities__ and to work on projects at __Assetplus Investment Management__.
