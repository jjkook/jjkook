I am anÂ M.S. candidate in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. My recent research interests are inÂ adaptive multi-period portfolio selection under different macroeconomic environments and learning to rank with multinomial logic contextual bandit model.Â More broadly my research interest includes portfolio optimization, reinforcement learning, bandit algorithms, and their applications

Since 2016, I initiated and led theÂ Financial Bigdata AnalysisÂ student research group whichÂ studiesÂ the field at the intersection of quantitative finance and data science.Â I believe in the value ofÂ applying practical, cutting-edge data science technologies into traditionalÂ investment strategies

I have also had the pleasure to participate in a project engaged with NH Investment and Securities and to work on projects at Assetplus Investment Management
