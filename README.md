I am a master's student majoring in __Computational Finance__ at __Carnegie Mellon University__, __Tepper School of Business__. 

My recent research interests are in __factor modeling__, __portfolio optimization__, and __derivatives pricing__. I am also interested in __statistical machine learning__, __reinforcement learning__, and their applications in finance.

Since 2016, I initiated and led the __FBA Quant__ quantitative finance student research group which studies the field at the intersection of __quantitative finance__ and __data science__. I believe in the value of applying practical, cutting-edge data science technologies to traditional investment strategies.
