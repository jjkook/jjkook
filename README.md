I am a master's student majoring in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. My recent research interests are in quantitative portfolio management, finite difference methods for financial derivatives. I am also interested in reinforcement learning, bandit algorithms, statistical machine learning and their applications in finance.

Since 2016, I initiated and led the FBA Quant student research group which studies the field at the intersection of quantitative finance and data science. I believe in the value of applying practical, cutting-edge data science technologies into traditional investment strategies.

I have also had the pleasure to participate in a project engaged with NH Investment and Securities and to work on projects at Assetplus Investment Management.
